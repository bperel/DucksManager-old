00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
This short tutorial will explain how to use CollecTable,
a condensed way to list your issues collection.

2
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:17,000
We possess 8 issues here :
3 "Mickey Parade" and 5 "Picsou Magazine".

3
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:24,001
Let's see how CollecTable stores these issues.
Each issue is represented by a letter.

4
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:29,002
Let's see the first issue. Its letter represents its "hundreds" part.

5
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:33,003
The legend gives the correspondance :
"d" corresponds to issues between 301 and 400.

6
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:38,004
The tens and units of this issue is indicated
by the header of the column he is under.

7
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:44,505
The first issue is as a consequence the #316. It is followed by issues #317 and #322.
These are the "Mickey Parade" of the user.

8
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:49,006
Let's see the "Picsou Magazine" issues.

9
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,007
The letter, as the legend indicates it, corresponds to issues between 201 and 300.

10
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:56,608
The user has got, as a consequence, issues #214...

11
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,609
and #227.

12
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,210
Another issue is written under it, on the 2nd row.

13
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:12,511
The principle is the same, excepted that we will consider the 2nd header row.
So the user has got issue #275.

14
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:17,412
2 last issues are indicated, at the end of the 2nd row :

15
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:24,413
one of them is between 1 and 100 (letter "a"), the other between 201 and 300 ("c").

16
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:30,714
They are located under the column "50-100".
As they are on the 2nd row, the user has got the issues #100 and #300.
